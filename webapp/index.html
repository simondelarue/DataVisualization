			<h1>Ratings analysis</h1>

			<!-- Global information -->
			<p class="global-info"><strong>Five personality characteristics are evaluated ; Intelligence, sincerity, attractiveness, ambition and fun. For each of them, candidates gave ratings between 1-100.  These characteristics can refer to auto-evaluation or third-party evaluation, at different moments in the speed dating process.</strong>
			<i>For example, candidates were asked : You have 100 points to distribute among the following attributes --give more points to those attributes that are more important in a potential date, and fewer points to those attributes that are less important in a potential date. Total points must equal 100.</i></p>
